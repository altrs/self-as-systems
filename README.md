I AM ALONE<br>
Self-as-Systems Data Portrait <br><br>

This webpage is meant to be an exploration of systems of thought. Based on the user's answers on the questionaire, the webpage 'environment' will ultimately reflect the user's outlook of what it means to 'be alone' <br><br>

Functionality List:<br>

-Move head around to generate objects onto the 'canvas.'<br>
-Click the objects to get (semi)randomly generated text. <br>
-Open questionaire and answer questions to change the behavior of the objects, they may or may not start to sprout heads and send you emails. <br>
-The bottom corner blinking div represents my binary data collected about being alone v.s. not alone: if your quiz answers lean towards the second system of thought, this bar will disappear. <br>
-Answer all the questions for a binary/nuance 'score' <br>
-Access Info Page through bottom left button <br>
-You can also enter your name at the top of the quiz :>
