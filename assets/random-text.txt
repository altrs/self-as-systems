This memory manifests rescued memory
Your concavity? What weaponizes your mechanized memory? It is, surprisingly, that "concavity."
Why must thine lurid season dance ostensibly? actually, the dirt doth rock thine domicile.
What endures my season? For what pilots she upon that dirt?
Wicked jelly-lards doth offend the like, prison.
Pongorma pilots many lards. But will they manifest that concavity?
Fatal homunculus-homunculuses doth lament the like, homunculus.
Eyes closed, clay destinies. 
Visitors, visitors, we are visitors. 
We are beings made of many different parts. 
And what do you see when you look to the right? 
The concept functions as a disguise.

In a basement lab a light flashes

I feel more beautiful when I am with others
How many days have again gone silently by?
Creatures creatures creatures

Where's our audience! They should be here momentarily...

Everything around us is alive
Everything has a soul
You might not notice a thing
You might not notice a thing

Like a rubber neck giraffe
Sometimes we don't see things as they are
Sometimes we don't see things as they are
Sometimes we don't see things as they are
