To do list

	Assets:
	- Head (multiple?)
	- Objects (10)
	- Background Videos (5)
	- Randomly generated words
	- Email notification
	- Entity (3)


	Functions remaining (10/1):
	X-calculate ratio-based questionnaire score for user
	X-use score to dictate how many objects on screen will have heads
	X-if score is high, have objects send messages
	-if score is 100%, change all object images to the user's head
	-add background image function
	-add sound effects
	-create and upload assets
	-add personal data interaction and then a "actually though, what is this?"


Scoring system: Of the currently answered questions, the percentage of 'not-alone'-leaning answers will dictate the ratio of objects with heads. Score of 0-15 (one point for each question)

The higher the nonbinary score, the more heads there will be

Ex. There are 17 heads: 
if(score = 0){100% objects have heads}
else if(score = 1-3){80% objects have heads}
else if(score = 4-8){60% objects have heads}
else if(score = 9-13){30% objects have heads}
else if(score = 14-15){5% objects have heads}
