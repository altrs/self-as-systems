    <h2>INFO</h2>
    <p>
      Data I'm basing my project off of is the time during the week I was alone v.s. when I was not alone. This webpage is meant to be an exploration of systems of thought. The webpage 'environment' will ultimately reflect the user's outlook of what it means to 'be alone' (Based on the user's answers on the questionaire).
